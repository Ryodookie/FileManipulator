# File Manipulator

This simple Python script, named "File Manipulator," demonstrates basic
file handling and word frequency counting.The script reads the contents of
a text file specified by the file path, counts the occurrences of each
word, and prints the word frequencies in a column-like order.

## Learning Objectives

- File Handling - The script utilizes the open function to read the contents
  of a text file and checks for its existence using os.path.isfile.
- Exception Handling - It demonstrates handling specific exceptions such as FileNotFoundError
- Counter Module - The collections.Counter module is employed to count word occurrences.

This project serves as a learning exercise in basic file manipulation,
exception handling, and utilizing Python modules for data processing.
